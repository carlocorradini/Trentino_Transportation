# Project domain
This project aims to comprehensively consider the transportation situations under the specific Trentino region, not only involving the public transportation services but also the personal tracks. Collecting the latest temporal and spatial information and integrating the data and knowledge from diverse sources. Public transportation services, vehicles, bus stations, train stations, railways, highways, simple streets, public transportation service timelines, and trip schedules are the main important elements that will be mainly paid attention, besides, the mixed using of some vehicles and the parking path will be exploring
# Purpose
With the development of big data technology and cloud storage technology, we are in an era of the rapid increase in information, with countless data or knowledge. How to manage these data and achieve more efficient sharing and utilization is an area that many researchers are exploring, that is, to fulfill the integration of knowledge and data in specific, rather than leaving information be unorganized. This report focuses on integrating all the public transportation as well as sharing vehicles information within Trentino so that a more complete transport information system could help people make a better decision and save time or money as much as possible. Specifically, we pay attention to the application of vehicles that GTFS has not covered, such as sharing bikes, sharing cars, and so on so forth, which is added to the system, and then residents have more choices when determining paths.
